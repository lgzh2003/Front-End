##Introduction
Javascript is a one-thread language, not like JAVA which allows multi-thread. Java is safer than Node.js, in this case node.js can beat PHP but not for JAVA.                                       
                 
Node.js is not a javascript framework. **It is a development platform that makes it possible to let javascript run on server.**
