##Call back function and Event
####What is call back?      
Callback is an asynchronous equivalent for a function. A callback function is called at the completion of a given task. Node makes heavy use of callbacks. All the APIs of Node are written in such a way that they support callbacks.          
           
For example, a function to read a file may start reading file and return the control to the execution environment immediately so that the next instruction can be executed. Once file I/O is complete, it will call the callback function while passing the callback function, the content of the file as a parameter. So there is no blocking or wait for File I/O. **This makes Node.js highly scalable, as it can process a high number of requests without waiting for any function to return results.**                                


                       
         
                     
[Synchronized Reading File](readFileSynchronized.js)             
```
var fs = require('fs');
var data = fs.readFileSync('file.txt','utf-8');
console.log(data);
console.log('end,');
```       
             
[ASynchronized Reading File](readFileAsynchronized.js)           
```
var fs = require('fs');
fs.readFile('file.txt','UTF-8',function(err,data){
	if(err)	{
		console.log('read file err');
	}else{
		console.log(data);
	}
});
console.log('end,');
```     
            
[one second after excute the function(normal event)](event.js)                           
```
//Step1: declare event object
var EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter;
var event = new EventEmitter();
//Step2: Register an event, and write a Callback Function
event.on('some_event',function () {
    console.log('It is a self defiend event');
});
//Step3: trigger the event
    setTimeout(function () {// setTimeout here means after 1 seconds let the event emit
        event.emit('some_event'); //emit here is like trigger
    },1000);
